# Machine learning course project - Movie Rating Prediction through Topic Modeling

The movie industry is growing in a rapid pace with billions of dollars of investments. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to predict the success of a particular film. In this paper, we build machine learning models to predict the success of a film through [**IMDb**](https://www.imdb.com/) ratings. Boosting methods, such as [**XGBoost**](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [**CatBoost**](https://catboost.ai/) are employed, and the results of the models are compared used ROC-AUC metric. Besides including the given features in the models, we create an additional features based on the topic of the movie synopsis using [**BERTopic**](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic) framework. The ROC-AUC scores of the models range from 0.79 to 0.82 with no additional power gained with the use of topics.
